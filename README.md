## Writeup

### What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
The most challenging part was connecting the front end to the back end. I spent a very long time debugging because bugs can result from so many different parts: rerouting errors, forgetting to import certain dependencies, typos in URLs, backend logic mistakes, and more.

### Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
I would add a reset password feature, follow/unfollow users, and the ability to like and comment on posts.

### What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
I assumed that editing a post would not change its timestamp, so edited posts would not affect the chronological order of the posts. I also assumed that users cannot change their usernames.

### How long did this assignment take to complete?
About 60 hours in total.

## Extra Credits

- Password Encryption (using JWT)
- Image Status Updates (using Cloudinary)
